      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;heading&#34;&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I developed metrics to quantify physical climate risks, such as water scarcity and agricultural yields, and applied these to case studies focused on local climate resiliency, national security, and climate justice. I collaborated with domestic and international communities to provide uniquely tailored climate risk assessments and worked with private entities to incorporate climate risk into investment decision-making. I was motivated to address how climate change amplified existing socio-economic and structural inequities through an intersectional lens of physical climate risk and human vulnerability.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
