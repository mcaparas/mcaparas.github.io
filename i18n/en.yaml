    <p class="lead">
      Welcome! I’m Monica Caparas—a climate change researcher, movement artist, and justice advocate dedicated to addressing the intersection of societal and environmental systems.
    </p>
    <p class="lead">
      My scientific career is grounded in cross-disciplinary collaborations that blend rigorous research with community-driven solutions to tackle some of the world’s most pressing challenges. As a dancer and aerialist, I explore creative expression as a way to process and reflect on the complexities of the world around us.
    </p>
    <p class="lead">
      Rooted in my lived experiences as a queer child of Filipino immigrants and first-generation college graduate, I bring a unique perspective shaped by navigating inequities and diverse cultural landscapes.
    </p>
    <p class="lead">
      Together, let's shape a future where science, art, and equity drive meaningful change toward justice and sustainability.
