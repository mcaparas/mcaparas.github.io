    <p class="lead">
      My past research has examined the impact of climate change in the tropics, looking at changes in atmospheric circulation, extreme precipitation, and water-stressed forest phenology. I use climate models, big data analysis, and data visualizations to understand climate risks and impacts. I hold a B.Sc. in mathematical geophysics with a focus on climate modeling from Brown University.

      Prior to joining Woodwell Climate, I was a professional dancer and aerialist. I love training multiple circus art disciplines, advocating for social justice, warm water scuba diving, and working from home with my dogs in Las Vegas, NV.
