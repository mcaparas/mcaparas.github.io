    <p class="lead">
      My past research has examined the impact of climate change in the tropics, looking at changes in atmospheric circulation, extreme precipitation, and water-stressed forest phenology. I use climate models, big data analysis, and data visualizations to understand climate risks and impacts. I hold a B.Sc. in mathematical geophysics with a focus on climate modeling from Brown University.
    </p>
    <p class="lead">
      Prior to joining Woodwell Climate, I was a professional dancer and aerialist. I love training multiple circus art disciplines, advocating for social justice, warm water scuba diving, and working from home with my dogs in Las Vegas, NV.

#  translation: "I analyze and visualize physical climate risks to inform data-driven solutions for climate resiliency, adaptation, and planning as a Research Associate in the Climate Risk Program at the Woodwell Climate Research Center. I collaborate with global and local stakeholders—including governments, nonprofits, and private industries—to co-design strategies that address climate change impacts across various sectors. With expertise in climate and geospatial data analysis and visualization, I strive to bridge the gap between complex data and actionable insights."
