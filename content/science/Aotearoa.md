### Project motivation
Governmental CMIP5 climate projection data for Aotearoa New Zealand were available to the public for a fee as static maps, posing a financial accesibility barrier as well as limited use barrier. Partnering with Te Kereru Associates to eliminate these barriers for Māori tribes, my team at Woodwell re-created six climatic variables (average temperature, hot days, frost days, average precipitation, wet days, and extreme wet days) over Aotearoa New Zealand for four time periods under SSP585 using bias-adjusted, statistically downscaled CMIP6 global climate model output. I use Google Earth Engine Apps to create a [data viewer](https://modular-crawler-244718.projects.earthengine.app/view/new-zealand-2) of the climate risk layers. The data viewer is in a preliminary development stage. We plan to present the data viewer, methodology, and how to use climate data for adaptation and planning needs to Ngāti Rangi ki Ngāwha Hapū tribe.
