### Project summary
Seventy-two percent of today’s staple crops of maize, wheat, soybean, and rice are grown in just five countries, in regions known as breadbaskets. From the plains of North America to the river valleys of India and China, these regions earned their distinction for supporting hundreds of years of agricultural production with their climatic suitability. To understand potential risk to future food security, I assessed how well staple crops will be able to grow in their respective breadbaskets in a changing climate using AgMIP-CMIP5 output. The consequence of breadbasket failures mirrors an overarching theme of the climate crisis—the most vulnerable populations will be hit the hardest.
