### Project summary
Seventy-two percent of today’s staple crops—maize, wheat, soybean, and rice—are grown in just five countries, within regions known as breadbaskets. From the plains of North America to the river valleys of India and China, these regions have earned their distinction by supporting centuries of agricultural production due to their climatic suitability. To assess potential risks to future food security, I analyzed how well these staple crops will grow in their respective breadbaskets under a changing climate, using AgMIP-CMIP5 output. The consequences of breadbasket failures reflect a recurring theme of the climate crisis: the most vulnerable populations will be hit the hardest.
