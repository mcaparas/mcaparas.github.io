### Project summary
The McKinsey Global Institute (MGI), the business and economics research arm of McKinsey & Company, consults academic advisors and industry experts to inform its research. In 2019, Woodwell joined leading institutions and thought leaders in MGI’s working group on climate risk. We contributed much of the climate science analysis for MGI’s landmark global report, *Climate Risk and Response: Physical Hazards and Socioeconomic Impacts*, as well as the subsequent Asia-focused report, *Climate Risk and Response in Asia*. Our work centered on near- to medium-term (10–30 years) climate risks and their socio-economic impacts.
