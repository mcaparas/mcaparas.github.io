### Project summary
McKinsey Global Institute (MGI), the business and economics research arm of global management consulting firm McKinsey & Company, seeks the advice of academic advisors and industry experts to inform its research. In 2019, Woodwell Climate Research Center scientists joined a number of leading institutions and thought leaders in MGIâ€™s working group on climate risk. We produced much of the climate science analysis in MGI's landmark global report, *Climate risk and response: Physical hazards and socioeconomic impacts*, and subsequent Asia report, *Climate risk and response in Asia*, focusing on near- to medium-term (10-30 years) risks from climate change and their socio-economic effects.
