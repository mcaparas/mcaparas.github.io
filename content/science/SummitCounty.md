### Project summary
As part of Woodwell’s JUST ACCESS initiative to provide free climate risk insights to municipalities across the globe, my team worked with members of Summit County’s Sustainability Department to target three major climate risk variables for analysis—drought, water scarcity, and wildfire. This work was presented to the Summit County Board of Health, resulting in the Health Department hosting a speaker series on climate and health. The speaker series focused on sharing the results of the report to help county residents better understand the extent of risk where they live.
