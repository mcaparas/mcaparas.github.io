### Project summary
As part of Woodwell’s JUST ACCESS initiative, which provides free climate risk insights to municipalities worldwide, my team collaborated with Summit County’s Sustainability Department to analyze three major climate risk variables: drought, water scarcity, and wildfire. This work was presented to the Summit County Board of Health, leading to the Health Department hosting a speaker series on climate and health. The series shared the report's findings to help county residents better understand the risks they face in their communities.
