### Project motivation
Las Vegas is one of the fastest warming cities in the world and recently has been affected by summer flash flooding. People experiencing homelessness are at the forefront at environmental risks, especially people experiencing unsheltered homeless who live outdoors or underground in our tunnels. I work with Nevada Homeless Alliance and Southern Nevada Lived X Consultants to assess the heat and flooding exposure to people experiencing homelessness presently and in the future due to climate change. This work will support homeless service providers in coordinating outreach and resource distribution throughout the city. Intital results of this project were presented at the American Geophysical Union 2024 Fall Meeting.
