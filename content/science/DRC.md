### Project summary

In collaboration with the Ministry of the Environment and Sustainable Development (MEDD) of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), my team developed a localized, customized, and cost-free climate risk assessment aligned with the DRC’s National Strategic Development Plan and the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. Together, through a series of workshops, we identified and refined key climate risks—drought, heat stress, agricultural risk, extreme precipitation, flooding, and wildfire—to support disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation planning in the DRC. At COP28, Woodwell and the MEDD jointly released *From Risk to Resilience: A Strategic Assessment of Challenges and Solutions to Scaling Climate Mitigation and Adaptation in the Democratic Republic of Congo.*
