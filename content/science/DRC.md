### Project summary

In collaboration with the Ministry of the Environment and Sustainable Development (MEDD) of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), my team created a localized, customized, cost-free climate risk assessment aligned with both the DRC's National Strategic Development Plan and the United Nation's Sustainable Development Goals. Through a series of workshops together, climate risks of drought, heat stress, agricultural yields, extreme precipitation, flooding, and wildfire were identified and refined to support disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation planning in the DRC. At COP28, Woodwell and the MEDD jointly released *From Risk to Resilience: A strategic assessment of challenges and solutions to scaling climate mitigation and adaptation in the Democratic Republic of Congo*.
