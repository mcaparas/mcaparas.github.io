### Project summary
Climate change is expected to increase the intensity and frequency of extreme precipitation events, impacting stormwater management, water quality, public health, and transportation. In the tropics, the atmospheric branch of the El Nin√µ Southern Oscillation called the Walker Circulation plays a dominant role in extreme precipitation. Climate models underestimate extreme precipitation when compared to observations, and indicate a weakening of the Walker Circulation despite recent observations supporting the opposite (strengthening of the Walker Circulation). By simulating various Walker Circulation strengths under increasingly warmer global temperatures using the GFDL Idealized Moist Spectral Atmospheric Model, Dr. Jung-Eun Lee and I identify relationships between the strength of the Walker Circulation, sea surface temperature gradient, and frequency and intensity of extreme precipitation.
